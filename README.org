** Day 42
 - UICollectionView
 - Custom Cell class - and casting when dequeuing:
#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
    override func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {
        guard let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier: "Person", for: indexPath) as? PersonCell else {
            fatalError("Unable to dequeue a Person cell.")
        }
        
        return cell
    }
#+END_SRC

** Day 43
 - Added a UIImagePickerController():
#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
        let picker = UIImagePickerController()
        picker.allowsEditing = true // the user can crop the picture
        picker.delegate = self
        present(picker, animated: true)
#+END_SRC
 - Conforming to UIImagePickerControllerDelegate, UINavigationControllerDelegate
 - Delegate method: didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo
It returns a dictionary, with keys for .editedImage:
#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
guard let image = info[.editedImage] as? UIImage else { return }
#+END_SRC
 - Generate a UUID().uuidString
 - getDocumentsDirectory()
#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
    func getDocumentsDirectory() -> URL {
        let path = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)
        return path[0]
    }
#+END_SRC
 - Convert UIImage to jpeg and write it to disk
 - Implemented a data structure to hold the person name and the image file name. Modified the Data Source methods to show the proper data.
 - Added a Alert Controller with a text field to modify the person's name when the cell is tapped.
** Day 44 - Challenge
 
 1. Add a second UIAlertController that gets shown when the user taps a picture, asking them whether they want to rename the person or delete them.1.  
 2. Try using picker.sourceType = .camera when creating your image picker, which will tell it to create a new image by taking a photo. This is only available on devices (not on the simulator) so you might want to check the return value of UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable() before trying to use it!
